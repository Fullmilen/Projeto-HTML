                    Your leg when it breaks in half sounds like a wet tree branch snapping. 
                    I swear to God. Go outside, find a tree, throw some water on it, and snap it in half. 
                    That wet, crunchy sound? That’s your leg snapping. 
                    That’s your tibia and fibula bones breaking. | © Benjamin L. Hobson

                    The city had not gone to sleep, as there are very few cities left in the world that still sleep 
                    and those that do aren’t frequented. Nevertheless, the city was as near to sleep as 
                    it ever would be, and thus our story begins. The sky, beyond the thick layer of smog and 
                    the even thicker layer of fog and a slightly less thick but nonetheless significant layer 
                    of cloud from which rain plummeted, was black with a plethora of stars in various 
                    arrangements. Some said they could see a spoon, a bear, or even a warrior in these stars, 
                    but truly there were no utensils or animals or people of any occupation in the sky. People 
                    just liked to add meaning to the random scatterings, so we let them name the stars’ shapes 
                    and enjoy the constellations when they can see them, which isn’t often for our city dwellers.
